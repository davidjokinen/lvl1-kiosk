# lvl1-kiosk
Help with the kiosk by adding/inproving slides or commercials! 
## Slides
This is where the main content goes. Examples would be Info, Calendar and pictures.

## Commercials
This is where fun non important things go. The goal the the commercials is to stop the screen burning on the TV and to show off the talent of LVL1! 

### Easy Commercial template
Located in 'commercials/template' is a template that will give you a full screen canvas with example code to get started building your own cool idea! The 'index.html' is where the html goes. It is important to include all your javascipt in this file! The file 'mycommercial.js' (in the 'js' folder) is where the main logic and rending goes. And example class 'box.js' shows how to create objects.
